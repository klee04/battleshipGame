To compile and run, run the following commands:
    make        (build script)
    .bin/app    (run executable)

Note: Make sure all files in the src folder are included in your IDE's include path
Note: All paths are relative to the folder "battleship", so the exectuable won't 
      recognize the resources if you aren't running it from that directory
